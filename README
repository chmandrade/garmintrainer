 == Building ==

GarminTrainer uses the Maven build system. Maven gets all dependencies from 
the maven repository. However, one of the dependencies is not in the main
repository and has to be installed into the local repository. Do this using 
the install_extra_libs.sh script.
 
 $ install_extra_libs.sh 

To create a runnable jar of GarminTrainer, run

 $ mvn assembly:assembly

This will create a jar, with all dependencies, in the target/ directory.

 == Code ==

The Map viewer code is taken from http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JMapViewer. 
JMapViewer is based on the map viewer used in JOSM, the Openstreetmap editor.
